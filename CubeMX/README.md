# STM32CubeMX Generated Files

This folder contains files generated by [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html), as set under the GUI option `Project Manager > Project > Toolchain Folder Location`.

The Makefile build system is not used in this project, in favour of CMake. The files in this directory are used as follows:
